**Requirements**: Python 2.7, 3.3+

### Installation

To install, use pip.

    pip install coreapi

---

### Retrieving and inspecting documents

To initially access a Core API interface, use the `get()` function.

    >>> import coreapi
    >>> doc = coreapi.get('http://coreapi.herokuapp.com')

We can now inspect the returned document.

    >>> print(doc)
    <Notes 'http://coreapi.herokuapp.com/'>
        'notes': [
            <Note '/e7785f34-2b74-41d2-ab3f-f754f688987c/'>
                'complete': False,
                'description': 'Schedule design meeting',
                'delete': link(),
                'edit': link([description], [complete]),
            <Note '/626579bd-b2ba-40d0-92af-9ff0bfa5f276/'>
                'complete: True,
                'description': 'Write release notes',
                'delete': link(),
                'edit': link([description], [complete])
        ],
        'add_note': link(description)

Documents are key-value pairs, and their elements can be accessed by indexing into them.

    >>> doc['notes'][0]['description']
    'Schedule design meeting'

You can also inspect the document URL and title.

    >>> doc.url
    'http://coreapi.herokuapp.com/'
    >>> doc.title
    'Notes'

### Interacting with documents

Documents in the Python Core API library are immutable objects. To perform a transition we use the `coreapi.action()` function and assign the resulting new document.

    >>> doc = coreapi.action(doc, ['add_note'], params={'description': 'My new note.'})

The arguments to `.action()` are:

* The existing document.
* A string or list of strings or integers, indexing the link to act on.
* Any parameters to use when the acting on the link.

Transitions may update part of the document tree.

    >>> doc = coreapi.action(doc, ['notes', 0, 'edit'], params={'complete': True})
    >>> doc['notes'][0]['complete']
    True

Or they may remove part of the document tree.

    >>> while doc['notes']:
    >>>     doc = coreapi.action(doc, ['notes', 0, 'delete'])
    >>> len(doc['notes'])
    0

### Saving and loading documents

To save or load documents into raw bytestrings, use `dump()` and `load()`.

For example, to save a document to disk.

    content_type, content = coreapi.dump(doc)
    file = open('doc.json', 'wb')
    file.write(content)
    file.close()

To load the same document back again.

    file = open('doc.json', 'rb')
    content = file.read()
    file.close()
    doc = coreapi.load(content)
